	<p class="space30 editContent"> Blogs are, in many ways, the Swiss Army knives of the internet.

Starting out as online diaries in the 90s, blogging has grown into a massive, endlessly varied form of communication.

Blogs can be short story collections, recipe hubs, role-playing games, or records of UFO sightings. They can help businesses advertise, educate customers, inform shareholders, or inspire community interactions.

Chances are if you can imagine it, there is a blog about it somewhere. Probably hundreds of them!

Blogs are one of the last level playing fields on the web. What are you waiting for?</p>
	<p>Blogging is simply the act of starting and writing a blog!

Blogs are so ubiquitous because anyone who’s able to put type can become a blogger. You don’t need to know how to type fast; you don’t need to be able to see or hear. You can’t be too old or too young to blog. You don’t even need to know anything about computers or the internet! </p>
<p>
	People blog for many reasons. Blogging can help you become a better writer, can make you some money on the side, or give you a platform for sharing your ideas.
Sometimes figuring out what to blog about is the hardest part.
